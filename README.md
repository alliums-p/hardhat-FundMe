# hardhat-FundMe
 Building FundMe project using hardhat - a tutorial from freecodecamp by patrick collins

Through this lesson you can learn to:
- Use `hardhat-deploy` for deployments and  ease of testing,
- Use `hardhat-deploy-ethers` to use ether.js for `hardhat-deploy`,
- Use `mocks` to use hardcoded contracts unavailable in development (chainlink contracts and similar)
- Use `NatSpec` for documentation for dev and user
- Use `staging` and `unit` testing methods. 
- Use `gas optimization` through the help of `gas-reporter`
- Use `scripts` in `package.json` to shorten commands


**Note**
Unit tests are done locally (hardhat/localhost)
Staging tests can be done on a testnet
